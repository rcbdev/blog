description: Native development for mobile platforms is dead. Xamarin now allows true cross platform apps without the penalties associated with solutions such as PhoneGap.

Native development is dead. This may sound like a bold statement, but I believe it to be true, finally. The death of native mobile app development (and desktop development) has been touted for a long time now, but I feel it finally is coming to the point where traditional native mobile app development can no longer be recommended. The reason for this? Xamarin.

Much has been said about hybrid app solutions like PhoneGap (and its open source cousin Apache Cordova), but they have never reached the potential that people have put on them. Hybrid solutions are always held back by the fact that they need to be interpreted and translated at run time. This is due to the fact that hybrid apps are actually just offline websites posing as an app. This means they can never match the performance of a traditional native app, and they always tend to feel slightly off. Xamarin, on the other hand, creates a true native app, without the traditional native development.

Having worked with Xamarin for some time now, I would not develop apps using Objective C for iPhone or Java for Android. Even if you are only developing for a single platform at this point in time, there will be a time in the, probably quite near, future when you wish to support a second or third platform. At this point, you will wish you went with Xamarin from the start.

Xamarin allows you to develop true native apps for Android and iPhone, alongside Windows 8 and Windows Phone, using C# and the .NET Framework. In addition, they allow you to share your C# code between all these platforms through portable class libraries and shared projects. This allows a huge amount of your code to be shared between platforms, meaning when you inevitably decide to make your application cross platform, the amount of work required is mainly limited to user interface design.

Because Xamarin compiles your app to a native app for each platform, there is no limitation on the performance as there is on a hybrid PhoneGap app. This means your users won't even realise they're not on a natively developed app! There really is no reason not to check out Xamarin for you next app and prepare yourself for the increasingly cross platform world out there.
