Starting a blog is something that I have wanted to do for a while, and have finally decided to do. I work as a software developer, developing bespoke software solutions, and so I will be using this blog as a way of sharing various coding hints, tips, and tutorials about techniques I have learnt when developing.

As I have learnt most of what I know about programming from the internet, including many blogs, I thought itâ€™s time I gave a little back and shared some advice too.

I hope one day this will help another developer learn something new.
