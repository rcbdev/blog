At work, we often have special days known as Hack Days when everyone is free to work on a project of their choice. This has previously included projects such as a hovercraft, online games, and an internet controlled xylophone. I've had an idea I have been interested in pursuing for a while, and decided to attempt it on our latest Hack Day. This was a 3D scanner.

3D scanners aren't new, but consumer scanners are still rare and quite expensive to purchase. I was interested in finding out more about how they work, and seeing whether they were as complex as their price suggests, or whether it was possible to build you own.

## How 3D Scanners Work

Most consumer 3D scanners work in an amazingly simple way. In essence, they consist of a webcam, a line laser, and a turntable. The webcam captures an image of the object, the line laser shines a line on the object from an angle, and the turntable rotates the object so that you can capture it from all angles.

When the line laser shines on the object you are scanning, it draws a line on the object. From the camera's angle, the line will appear to curve with the changing shape of the object. By extracting the laser's line from the image, you can calculate the depth the object at different heights. Rotate the object using the turntable, and we can collect this depth information from all angles and have a complete scan of it.

## Implementing the Scanner

To implement the 3D scanner, there were two main parts to complete. The hardware and the scanning software. For the hardware, I used an Arduino connected to a stepper motor and line laser module. These are all readily available and cheap pieces of hardware, and coupled with some wood and a cheap webcam complete the parts needed to make the scanner work.

The Arduino acted as a control system for the laser turning on and off, and the stepper motor rotating. By using the Serial interface available on the Arduino, I was able to control both the laser and the stepper motor from the scanning software, allowing complete control of what was happening from inside the software.

The software side of things was completed with a WPF application using C#. The application worked by taking a reference image, turning the laser on, and then taking another image. By comparing these two images the system could easily work out where the laser has hit the object without having to worry too much about the lighting conditions or background of the image interfering.

Once the position of the laser was determined, simple trigonometry could be used to work out the depth of the object based on the position the laser was seen and the angle of the laser. This provided a set of points for the object on the current "slice". The object is then rotated and more slices are captured until the entire object is scanned. The data can then be exported as a point cloud to be viewed and cleaned up in other software.

## Did it Work?

So, after a day of work on the scanner, it turned out pretty well and gave some reasonable scans for a first attempt!. Some work is needed to calibrate and fine tune the scanner to produce more accurate results and handle different types of objects better, but as a proof of concept it has shown me a DIY 3D scanner is more than possible. Below is an example of a point cloud captured of a simple object (you can download the ply file [here](/files/3dscan.ply)).

The WPF application code is available on my GitHub at [https://github.com/rcbdev/3D-Scan](https://github.com/rcbdev/3D-Scan). The Arduino code is very basic and involves listening for "0", "1", or "2" and moving the stepper motor/switching the laser on/off.
