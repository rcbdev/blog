Markdown is a fantastic markup language with a huge community backing. If you've ever been writing an document or blog post and been annoyed by how awkward editing tools like Word can be, Markdown may be the solution. Instead of trying to find an option or function hidden in a menu, you just use very simple markup to define what you want. Every blog post on this site is written in Markdown.

## What is Markdown?

Put simply, Markdown is a markup language that lets you easily build an HTML page. It has been created to aid with the writing process and not inhibit it. Instead of giving you complex syntax to remember and lots of additional markup to type, Markdown blends into the background and stays out of the way. For example, you want a heading? Just put "#" for a first level, "##" for a second level, etc. Want bullet points? Just but a "*" in front of each point.

## Why Use Markdown?

Markdown is fantastic for writing any sort of structure document. Be that blog posts, articles, or technical documents. Markdown allows you to simply write and forgot about how you are formatting your document. Instead of fiddling about with settings you can just write. With the size of the community behind Markdown, there's plenty of options for producing different output formats from your Markdown. Markdown was originally written as a simple way of producing HTML, but there's now converters that allow for a huge number of formats (such as Word documents). This means that no matter what reason you have for using Markdown, you should be able to produce a suitable document at the end of it.

## How to Use Markdown

In order to understand how to write in Markdown, you should check out the official Markdown syntax reference ([http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)). To write in Markdown, you can use any text editor you want. There's a large number available that will even preview the Markdown as you type (such as Github's Atom), or export as HTML. The amount of options available is huge, and way to many to cover in a single blog post! I'd recommend trying out Markdown now and seeing if it works for your writing.
